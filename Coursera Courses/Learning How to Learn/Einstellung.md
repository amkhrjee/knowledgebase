# Einstellung 
Oftentimes our initial understanding of a topic is wrong and hinders with our further investigation into that topic. 

In Einstellung, your simple initial thought, an idea you already have in mind, or a neural pattern youâ€™ve already developed and strengthened, may prevent a better idea or solution from being found.

Do not be trapped by einstellung!
