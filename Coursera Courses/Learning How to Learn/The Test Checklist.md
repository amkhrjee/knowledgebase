# The Test Checklist 
- Did you make honest effort to understand the text? 
- Did you workout problems? 
- Did you consult with the TA? 
- Did you get a reasonable night's sleep before the test? <- *the most important*


# Strategy 
Start with the hard problems then quickly jump to the easy ones. 
Doing this puts the mind in focus mode and then to diffuse mode when you are solving the easier problems. 

Keep doing this for all the hard problems! 

Pull yourself out of problems when you are stuck for 1 or 2 minutes.
