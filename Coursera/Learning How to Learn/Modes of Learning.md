There are two modes of learning 
- Focused learning 
- Diffused learning 
## Focused Learning 
In this mode you are supposed to be do stuff that you already know how to do, but its something that requires rigour and focus. 
Do stuff you already feel confident about in this mode. 
## Diffused Learning 
In this mode you are supposed to be in a semi-serious thinking mode. Maybe take a walk, sit down somewhere you like - it really depends on you, and let go of your mind. Let it imagine and dream about what you're trying to accomplish/understand. Don't be rigourous about things. Let things flow. Let ideas come and go. Maybe jot down the important ideas.
