# Chunking 
Chunking is the process of making small abstractions of memory and knowledge that you can trust on. It could be an elaborate process or some mathematcial procedure, you can form a chunk by deliberate practice and basic memorization - your aim with chunk should be to be able to use it without thinking about its own roots everytime you use it. 

Chunking is a bottom-up approach of learning something. It's like piecing together pieces of puzzle so that it helps form a kind of incomplete image of what's the big picture is about. 

Another approach is the top-down approach. It's seeing the big picture and getting the idea of how everything connects with each other and what's the big motivation of the topic that you're learning. 

Both of these approaches are necessary for a holistic learning. 

Chunks from one topic or subject often proves to be of help in other topic or subject, this is called *transfer*. 

Forming chunk = Deliberate practice + Basic memory 

Only understanding something is not often, you need to practice it to form a chunk. Here your goal is to form an abstraction layer. So that you don't have to think right from the basic when you encounter it somewhere. 

A **library of chunk** is extremely important for enabling you to think of new ideas by stiching together several chunks from various domanins.
