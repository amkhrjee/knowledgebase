# Retrieval Reading
The best way to go through a piece of text is to try to recall the section after going through it. It helps in understanding + registering the topic to memory. 

Trying to remember a topic or concept in a place other than your usual place of study can prove to be extremely helpful. 

# Illusion of Comepetence 
When you read some book or google some info, you can fool yourself into thinking that the info is now in your brain, but *beware!* that never is the case!

# Text Markup 
Text maarkup -> highlighting, annotating should not be overdone and should be kept at a minimum. 


# Deliberate Pratice
Do more of the stuff that's more difficult. Do not waste time doing simple things repeatedly. 

Doing simple things time over time is called *overlearning* and can fool you into thinking that you've mastered the topic.
